### 2. Background and Motivation  
The global energy landscape is rapidly transitioning towards renewable energy sources to combat climate change and reduce carbon footprints. In this context, smart homes equipped with renewable energy systems such as solar panels and wind turbines are gaining prominence. However, challenges remain in optimizing energy production, managing consumption, and facilitating efficient peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading among neighbors.  

Multi-agent systems (MAS) offer a promising framework to address these challenges. By deploying autonomous agents with specific roles, the system can dynamically adapt to varying energy demands, optimize resource usage, and enable seamless energy trading. This project aims to design and implement a MAS for smart homes to enhance energy efficiency and foster a collaborative energy ecosystem.

- **(15% Mark)** Create a peer-to-peer energy trading platform to facilitate secure and efficient energy transactions among neighboring homes.  
- **(15% Mark)** Evaluate the system’s performance in terms of energy efficiency, prediction accuracy, and trading efficacy.  
- **(30% Mark)** Use a Software Agent Development Environment (e.g., JADE) to develop the system. The methodology of the project should follow Agile principles.  
- **(10% Mark)** Collect datasets for the project:  
  - **Smart home datasets**: Appliance-level energy consumption.  
  - **Solar/Wind datasets**: Hourly energy production.  
  - **Power grid datasets**: Energy consumption at the lowest granular level.  

### 4. Deliverables  
#### 4.1 System Architecture  
The proposed system comprises the following components:  
- **Renewable Energy Sources**: Solar panels and/or wind turbines.  
- **Energy Storage**: Batteries for storing surplus energy.  
- **Multi-Agent System (MAS)**: Interaction model and protocol.  
- **User Interface**: Provides real-time insights and control options for homeowners.  

#### 4.2 Mathematical Model  
- Develop mathematical models for each agent and provide proofs of auction theories.  

#### 4.3 Predictive Modeling  
- Develop machine learning models (e.g., LSTM networks or hybrid approaches) to forecast short-term and long-term energy production and consumption based on historical data, weather conditions, and user behavior patterns.  

#### 4.4 Peer-to-Peer Trading Platform  
- Design a secure platform (e.g., blockchain-based) for transparent energy transactions.  
- Use smart contracts to automate trading processes based on predefined rules, ensuring fairness and efficiency.  

#### 4.5 Simulation and Testing  
- Simulate the system in a controlled environment using synthetic and real-world datasets.  
- Evaluate the MAS's performance under various scenarios, including peak demand, renewable energy surplus, and dynamic market conditions.
