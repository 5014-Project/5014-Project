"""
Module: Test Suite for Demand Response Agent

Description:
    This module contains unit tests for the Demand Response Agent, which is responsible for managing
    the demand response actions by interacting with the grid based on the predicted energy consumption
    and system status. The tests validate the agentâ€™s ability to respond to grid requests.

Inputs:
    - Test inputs for demand thresholds and response actions

Outputs:
    - Validate proper demand response actions and threshold management

Agents Needed:
    - DemandResponseAgent: The agent being tested
